# Hashing

Hashing is transformation of a string of charachters  to a shorted fixed length value that 
represents original text. A shorter value helps in indexing and faster searches.

In Java, every object has a method `public int hashcode()` that will return a hash value for given object.

A map is an associative array which lets you store a key value association:
    key1 -> value1
    key2 -> value2

Hashmap is an implementation of Map interface and is based on the technique of 'Hashing'

NOTE: If two objects are equal, they should have same hashcode

Hashcode is used to store values in Hashmap
